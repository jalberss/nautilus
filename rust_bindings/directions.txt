bindgen will freak out because it doesn't know about the definitions
of uint{8,16,32}_t as well as sint32_t (which is used in ps.h), so 
you may have to add the line #include <stdint.h> at the beginning of
the desired header file in order to get bindgen to work properly
To get sint32_t to work, I just added 'typedef int sint32_t' to
the top of the desired header file.
